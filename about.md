Algorithms for Quantitative Pedology (AQP) is a collection of code, ideas, documentation, and examples wrapped-up into several R packages. The theory behind much of the code can be found in [this Computers & Geosciences paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2012.10.020). AQP is very much a work in progress! If you are interested in contributing code, documentation, bug reports, or even scathing criticism, feel free to contact Dylan at dylan [dot] beaudette [at] ca [dot] usda [dot] gov. AQP is a collaborative effort, funded in part by the Kearney Foundation of Soil Science (2009-2011) and USDA-NRCS (2011-current).

The AQP suite of R packages are used to generate figures for [SoilWeb](http://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/soilweb-apps/), [Series Extent Explorer](http://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/see/), and [Soil Data Explorer](http://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/sde/?series=amador).
